# ps5-payload-sdk
This is an SDK for developing payloads targeted at exploited PS5s. ELF loaders
known to work include:
- [ps5-payload-elfldr][elfldr]
- [ps5-payload-websrv][websrv]
- [bdj-ipv6-hen][bdj-ipv6-hen]
- [elfloader][elfloader] via [ps5-jar-loader]
- [remote_lua_loader][remote_lua_loader]

Several artifacts in this repository originate from the [PS5SDK][PS5SDK] project.

## Prerequisites
On Debian-flavored operating systems, you can invoke the following commands to
install dependencies used by the SDK.
```console
john@localhost:ps5-payload-dev/sdk$ sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade # optional
john@localhost:ps5-payload-dev/sdk$ sudo apt-get install bash clang-18 lld-18 # required
john@localhost:ps5-payload-dev/sdk$ sudo apt-get install socat cmake meson pkg-config # optional
```

If you are using Fedora, you can install dependencies as follows (tested with version 41):
```console
john@localhost:ps5-payload-dev/sdk$ sudo dnf install bash llvm-devel clang lld # required
john@localhost:ps5-payload-dev/sdk$ sudo dnf install socat cmake meson pkg-config # optional
```

If you are using macOS, you can install them using the [Homebrew Package Manager][macos-brew] (tested with macOS Sequoia):
```console
john@localhost:ps5-payload-dev/sdk$ brew install llvm@18 # required
john@localhost:ps5-payload-dev/sdk$ export LLVM_CONFIG=/opt/homebrew/opt/llvm@18/bin/llvm-config # required
john@localhost:ps5-payload-dev/sdk$ brew install socat cmake meson # optional
```

## Quick-start
You can download a binary distribution of the SDK from [the latest release page][latest-rel],
then install it to your local storage, e.g,
```console
john@localhost:tmp$ wget https://github.com/ps5-payload-dev/sdk/releases/latest/download/ps5-payload-sdk.zip
john@localhost:tmp$ sudo unzip -d /opt ps5-payload-sdk.zip
```
Assuming you have all the prerequisites and you are on a POSIX system,
the binary distribution should work regardless of CPU architecture, e.g., x86_64, aarch64.

## Usage
```console
john@localhost:ps5-payload-dev/sdk$ export PS5_PAYLOAD_SDK=/opt/ps5-payload-sdk
john@localhost:ps5-payload-dev/sdk$ make -C samples/hello_world
john@localhost:ps5-payload-dev/sdk$ export PS5_HOST=ps5; export PS5_PORT=9021
john@localhost:ps5-payload-dev/sdk$ make -C samples/hello_world test
```

## Building the SDK
```console
john@localhost:ps5-payload-dev/sdk$ make DESTDIR=/opt/ps5-payload-sdk install
john@localhost:ps5-payload-dev/sdk$ export PS5_PAYLOAD_SDK=/opt/ps5-payload-sdk
john@localhost:ps5-payload-dev/sdk$ ./libcxx.sh # fetch, build, and install libcxx
```

## Adding new SCE Libs
If you have decrypted sprx files that you would like to interact with, you can
build stubs for them as follows:
```console
john@localhost:ps5-payload-dev/sdk$ sudo apt-get install wget python3 python3-pyelftools
john@localhost:ps5-payload-dev/sdk$ ln -s /path/to/sprx/libSceXYZ.sprx sce_stubs/libSceXYZ.sprx
john@localhost:ps5-payload-dev/sdk$ make -C sce_stubs stubs
john@localhost:ps5-payload-dev/sdk$ make DESTDIR=/opt/ps5-payload-sdk install
```

## Reporting Bugs
If you encounter problems with the SDK, please [file a github issue][issues].
If you plan on sending pull requests which affect more than a few lines of code,
please file an issue before you start to work on you changes. This will allow us
to discuss the solution properly before you commit time and effort.
